Name of Workflow: Git Forking Workflow

Description of Basic Git workflow:
    All of the users work on the master branch and continually add and commit changes to the code; works well in small groups of people and when the team members do not work on any huge projects relating to the master branch.


Description of Forking Workflow: 
    Forks are commonly used to manage the different versions of projects and help with software development for large teams. Smaller teams or people can fork the master repository, make independent changes, and make a pull request for the admin to decide if they want to incorporate the changes or not. A great use case for the forking process is to propose changes to a bug you have found in a project or to work on long-term project. This workflow is commonly used in open source projects because hundreds, maybe thousands of people are working on the project and you don’t want all users to have access to making changes to the master repository.

Key Differences from basic workflow, and key use cases:
Everyone works on the repository independently rather than collaboratively
You don’t make push requests, you make pull requests
The owner decides whether to merge individual work into the main project
Anyone can work on the project/// open source
Not everyone has admin rights
